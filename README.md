# React + Redux Hot Boilerplate
<br>

This repo is a collection of boilerplate code that I normally write when starting an App.

It has:
 - React + Redux set up.
 - A development webpack 2 + dev-server config with hot code reloading.
 - Eslint + Stylelint for linting JS and style files.
 - Sass + Sass Themify for structured styling.
 - VSCode launch config for chrome debugging.

### Get Started:

Clone the repo, then `npm install` and `npm start`.
